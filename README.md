# .NET Desktop Application - Legacy System Renewal

## Overview

This project involves the transformation of an old system, originally built as a FoxPro console application, into a modern .NET Desktop Application using .NET Core with Windows Forms. The primary challenge was to migrate the existing functionality while incorporating a local database solution to meet specific client requirements. The application relies on a local MSSQL database to facilitate offline usage, addressing the client's demand for certain features to work without internet connectivity.

## Features

- **Legacy System Migration:** Successfully migrates features and functionality from the old FoxPro console application to a .NET Core Windows Forms application.

- **.NET Core Framework:** Utilizes the .NET Core framework for enhanced performance, cross-platform compatibility, and modern development practices.

- **Windows Forms:** Implements a user-friendly interface using Windows Forms, providing a familiar and intuitive experience for users.

- **Local MSSQL Database:** Integrates a local MSSQL database to store and manage data locally, allowing the application to function offline.

- **Offline Functionality:** Addresses the client's requirement for specific features to be available even when the application is not connected to the internet.

## Known Issues

The project faced challenges related to the client's expectations for an online database. While the current implementation successfully provides offline functionality through a local database, it deviates from the original client demands. Future iterations or projects may need to revisit this aspect to align with potential changes in client requirements.
